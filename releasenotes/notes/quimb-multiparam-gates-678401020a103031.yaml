    The quimb backend now supports evaluating the gradient of
    multi-parameter gates, as long as the Qiskit gate maps directly to
    a quimb gate without change of parameters.  Currently,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.XXPlusYYGate` is the only
    multi-parameter gate supported by qiskit-quimb.
